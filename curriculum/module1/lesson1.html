                <h3>Good Shop Safety Habits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eye Protection:</strong> It is extremely important to protect your eyes while working under a vehicle with falling debris. In the shop, safety glasses
                      are one of the easiest ways to protect your eyes. At times, you will also need to utilize googles, or a complete face shield when working with liquids that could splash up in your face</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate Clothing:</strong> It is best practice to wear long pants, closed-toed shoes, and keep your shirt tucked in. loose fitting clothing and
                      long hair can get caught up in moving parts and will NOT let go.</li>
                    <li><strong></strong></li>
                </ul>
                    Ensure hoists have a safe working load capacity for the job.
                    Have someone check on you periodically if you’re working alone.
                  
                    Store chemicals and fluids tightly sealed and out of reach of children and pets.
                    Remember that your vehicle's safety affects you and others. If unsure, seek professional advice.

                    Rely solely on a jack when working under a vehicle. Use approved jack stands under the recommended support points.
                    Attempt to loosen very tight fasteners (e.g., wheel lug nuts) while the vehicle is on a jack, as it could fall.
                    Start the engine without ensuring the transmission is in Neutral or Park and the parking brake is engaged.
                    Remove the radiator cap from a hot cooling system. Let it cool first or cover it with a cloth to release pressure gradually.
                    Drain engine oil while it’s still hot enough to cause burns.
                    Touch engine or exhaust parts until they have cooled to avoid burns.
                    Siphon toxic liquids like gasoline, antifreeze, or brake fluid by mouth, or let them stay on your skin.
                    Inhale brake dust, as it can be hazardous.
                    Leave spilled oil or grease on the floor—clean it up immediately to prevent slipping.
                    Use loose-fitting wrenches or tools that might slip and cause injury.
                    Push wrenches when tightening or loosening bolts; pull them toward you instead. If you must push, use an open hand to avoid injury if the wrench slips.
                    Lift heavy parts alone—get assistance.
                    Rush through tasks or take unsafe shortcuts.
                    Allow children or animals near the vehicle while working.
