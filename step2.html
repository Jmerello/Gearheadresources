        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> Safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toe boots.</li>
            <li><strong>Know Emergency Protocols:</strong> Familiarize yourself with fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and emergency exits.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Lifting Techniques:</strong> Lift with your legs, not your back. Use jacks and hoists correctly.</li>

            <li><strong>Keep Work Area Clean:</strong> Prevent accidents by keeping tools and parts organized.</li>
        </ul>
