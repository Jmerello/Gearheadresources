        <!-- Lesson Overview -->
        <section>
            <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
            <p>Brake systems are critical to vehicle safety. In this lesson, we will cover the components of the brake system and how to perform basic maintenance to ensure optimal performance.</p>

        <!-- Brake Pads Maintenance -->
        <section>
            <h3>Brake Pads Inspection and Replacement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Jack, jack stands, wrench, brake pad set, brake grease.</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Lift the vehicle and remove the wheels. Inspect the brake pads for wear. If the pads are worn down, replace them with new ones. Apply brake grease where necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Use proper lifting techniques when raising the vehicle. Ensure the vehicle is securely supported before working underneath it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Brake Fluid Maintenance -->
        <section>
            <h3>Brake Fluid Check and Replacement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Brake fluid, wrench, clean cloth.</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Check the brake fluid reservoir level. If it's low, top up with the recommended brake fluid. If necessary, replace the brake fluid by bleeding the brakes to remove air from the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Avoid spilling brake fluid, as it can damage paint and other surfaces. Always dispose of old brake fluid properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Brake Lines and Rotors -->
        <section>
            <h3>Brake Lines and Rotors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inspect Brake Lines:</strong> Check for any leaks or damage to the brake lines. If the lines are damaged, they must be replaced immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect Brake Rotors:</strong> Inspect rotors for signs of wear or warping. If they are damaged, they need to be resurfaced or replaced.</li>
            </ul>
