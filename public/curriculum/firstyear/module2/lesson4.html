        <!-- Oil Change Content -->
        <section>
            <h3>Engine Oil Change</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Wrench, oil filter wrench, oil pan, funnel, new oil, and filter.</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Lift the vehicle, drain the old oil, replace the oil filter, and refill with fresh oil. Ensure you use the correct oil grade for the vehicle's specifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Wear gloves to prevent skin contact with hot oil. Ensure the vehicle is securely lifted to avoid accidents.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Transmission Fluid Content -->
        <section>
            <h3>Transmission Fluid Maintenance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Wrench, funnel, transmission fluid, gloves.</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Locate the transmission dipstick, check the fluid level, and add the recommended transmission fluid if necessary. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's specifications for fluid type and quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Ensure the engine is off before opening the fluid reservoir. Be cautious with hot components around the transmission.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Brake Fluid Content -->
        <section>
            <h3>Brake Fluid Maintenance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Wrench, brake fluid, clean container, gloves.</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Locate the brake fluid reservoir, remove the cap, and check fluid levels. If necessary, top up with the correct brake fluid type.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Be cautious not to spill brake fluid, as it can damage vehicle paint. Always dispose of old brake fluid properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Coolant Fluid Content -->
        <section>
