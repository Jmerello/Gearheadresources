            <h2>Lesson 6: Suspension System Maintenance</h2>
        </section>

        <!-- Lesson Overview -->
        <section>
            <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
            <p>The suspension system is vital for handling and ride comfort. In this lesson, we'll explore how to inspect, maintain, and repair the suspension components.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Suspension System Components -->
        <section>
            <h3>Suspension System Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Shocks, struts, springs, control arms, ball joints, and bushings.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> The suspension system absorbs road bumps, supports the vehicle's weight, and maintains tire contact with the road for better handling.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Shock Absorber Maintenance -->
        <section>
            <h3>Shock Absorber Inspection and Replacement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Jack, jack stands, wrench, shock absorbers, spring compressors (if needed).</li>
                <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Lift the vehicle and remove the wheel. Inspect the shock absorber for signs of leakage or wear. Replace if necessary, following the vehicle's manufacturer recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Use proper lifting techniques and secure the vehicle before working. Be cautious when handling compressed springs.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Ball Joint and Control Arm Maintenance -->
        <section>
            <h3>Ball Joint and Control Arm Inspection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inspect for Wear:</strong> Check ball joints for play and control arms for any signs of bending or damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> If the ball joints are worn, replace them immediately as they are critical for vehicle control and alignment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Spring Maintenance -->
        <section>
            <h3>Spring and Bushing Maintenance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inspect Springs:</strong> Check the suspension springs for cracks, corrosion, or sagging. If necessary, replace with appropriate springs.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect Bushings:</strong> Examine bushings for wear or deterioration. Worn bushings can cause handling issues and should be replaced promptly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Practice Exercises -->
        <section>
            <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
            <p>Complete the following tasks to reinforce your understanding of suspension system maintenance:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Describe the role of shock absorbers and the steps for inspecting them for wear or leakage.</li>
                <li>Explain how to check for wear in ball joints and control arms. What are the consequences of failing to replace them?</li>
                <li>Identify the signs of wear in suspension springs and bushings. How can this affect vehicle handling?</li>
            </ol>
