                <h3>Basic Shop Safety</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slips, Trips, and Falls:</strong> Keep floors clean and dry. Mark wet areas clearly and ensure tools and suplies are stored safely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> Always wear safety glasses, closed-toed shoes, gloves, and hearing protection when necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper Attire:</strong> Avoid loose clothing or jewelry that could get caught in machinery. Always tie back long hair.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Good Shop Safety Habits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eye Protection:</strong> It is extremely important to protect your eyes while working under a vehicle with falling debris. In the shop, safety glasses are one of the easiest ways to protect your eyes. At times, you will also need to utilize googles, or a complete face shield when working with liquids that could splash up in your face</li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate Clothing:</strong> It is best practice to wear long pants, closed-toed shoes, and keep your shirt tucked in. loose fitting clothing and long hair can get caught up in moving parts and will NOT let go.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifting & Hoisting Devices:</strong> Ensure hoists or other lifting devices have a safe working load limit to handle what your project.</li>                    
                    <li><strong>Buddy System:</strong> It's best practice to work with at least one other person in the shop.If that is not possible, at least let someone know where you are and what you're doing and have him/her check on you periodically.
                    <li><strong>Chemical & Fluids Safety:</strong> Store chemicals and automotive fluids tightly sealed and out of reach of children and pets. Some shops are equipped with lockers to house hazardous chemicals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember Vehicle Safety:</strong> Keep in mind that your vehicle's safety affects everyone on the road.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Habits to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Rely solely on a jack when working under a vehicle. Use approved jack stands at the appropriate support points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Attempt to loosen very tight fasteners (e.g., wheel lug nuts) while the vehicle is on a jack, as it could fall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Start the engine without ensuring the transmission is in Neutral or Park and the parking brake is engaged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Remove the radiator cap from a hot cooling system. Let it cool first or cover it with a cloth to release pressure gradually and wear gloves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Touch engine or exhaust parts until they have cooled to avoid burns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Siphon toxic liquids like gasoline, antifreeze, or brake fluid by mouth, or let them stay on your skin. If toxic liquids get on your skin- wash the area and seek assistance if rash appears.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Inhale brake dust, as it can be hazardous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Leave spilled oil or grease on the floor— clean it up immediately to prevent slipping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Use loose- fitting wrenches or sockets that might slip and cause injury. Always use the proper tool for the job.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Push wrenches when tightening or loosening bolts; pull them toward you instead. If you must push, use an open hand to avoid injury if the wrench slips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Lift heavy parts alone— get assistance. Help is always available- especially if you're willing to help others when needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Rush through repairs or take unsafe shortcuts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Allow children or animals near the vehicle while working.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Allow customers under the vehicle while on a lift.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Automotive Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Airbags:</strong> Airbags are powerful safety devices but can cause severe injury if mishandled. Follow all manufacturer guidelines and avoid working on or near airbags unless you’re trained. Never expose airbag components to heat or electricity, and handle them with caution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asbestos:</strong> Asbestos, found in some brake pads, clutch linings, and gaskets, is extremely hazardous when inhaled. Avoid creating dust when handling these components. Clean parts carefully and dispose of asbestos-containing materials following safety regulations. Assume all dust is toxic unless proven otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Gasoline is highly flammable. Never smoke or create sparks near fuel. Gasoline vapors can ignite easily, especially in confined spaces. If working with fuel, ensure proper ventilation and keep an approved fire extinguisher nearby. Store fuel safely and never attempt to extinguish fuel fires with water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fumes:</strong> Certain fumes, such as those from gasoline, solvents, and other chemicals, can be toxic and cause unconsciousness. Always work in well-ventilated areas, and avoid inhaling these vapors. If draining or handling chemicals, take precautions to protect yourself from exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Battery:</strong> Batteries can emit explosive gases and produce sparks. Always disconnect the negative (-) terminal first and reconnect it last to avoid short circuits. When working with the battery, wear eye protection and avoid open flames. If battery acid spills, clean it immediately with a solution of baking soda and water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternating Current:</strong> When using electrical tools, ensure all connections are safe and properly grounded. Inspect tools regularly for frayed wires or damaged plugs. Avoid using electrical equipment near water to prevent shock. Always follow manufacturer instructions for safe use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Ignition System Voltage:</strong> High voltage from the ignition system can cause severe shock. Avoid contact with ignition components while the engine is running or being cranked. If you need to check these components, ensure the ignition is off to prevent injury.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Burns</strong> Engine components, exhaust systems, and radiators can remain hot long after the vehicle has been turned off. Always allow sufficient cooling time before touching any part of the engine or exhaust. Use caution when working near the exhaust manifold or catalytic converter, as these parts reach extremely high temperatures.</li>
