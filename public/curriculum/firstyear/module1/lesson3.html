                    <li><strong>Check Tire Pressure:</strong> Ensure tires are inflated to the recommended pressure to avoid premature wear or accidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tire Rotation:</strong> Rotate tires every 6,000 to 8,000 miles to promote even wear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect Tire Condition:</strong> Look for signs of wear, such as bald spots or punctures, and replace tires as needed.</li>
                </ul>
